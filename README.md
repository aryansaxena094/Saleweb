# Portfolio
This is a portfolio of my work. It includes a variety of projects that I have worked on.
I will be using MERN stack for this.
1. MongoDB - Database: This will have all the data for the projects, experience, education, etc.
2. Express - Server: This will be the server that will serve the data to the client.
3. React - Client: This will be the client side of the application.
4. Node.js - Backend: This will be the backend of the application.
